Having good understanding on both filtering data and building model and model diagnostics, I also have great interest in machine learning as well as data visualization. Meanwhile, I have also took online courses to learn machine learning and get __SAS Certified Advanced Programmer for SAS 9 and  SAS Certified Base Programmer for SAS 9__. Although what I have learnt in Columbia University is not enough, I`m open to learn new techniques. Proficient __R, SAS__ and farmiliar with __python__, I also have the ability to be a great team member and write efficient code.
